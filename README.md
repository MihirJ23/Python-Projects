# Python-Projects
this repository contains various games and small projects that display skills in python

1. gameplay.py is a basic game that uses classes to create a team of heros and villians with different
attributes. Each player will be given turns to decide which player to attack and wins when the opposing
team has no remaining members left.
2. 0to100.py is a one player game that allows them to set a minimum and maximum. They will guess a random number
between those parameters while the ai will choose a random number set by them. Whoever is closer to that set number wins.
3. namesDraw.py uses BeuatifulSoup feature from the zipped python file to read HTML data, parse it, and count the
sum of the extracted numbers from the file (problem from coursera Python course)
4. main.py uses json and basic SQL commands to read data from a text file and organize it into a table which puts different
information in different categories
